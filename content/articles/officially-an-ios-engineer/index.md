March 2022, I couldn't believe it. After months of emailing managers, I finally found
a team that was willing to invest in my novice iOS background and bring me up to par to their
developer needs. After two years in data engineering working on backend and devops related tasks,
I was so ready to take on a new challenge that aligned more with my interests.

Rewinding a year before this moment, it was an internal iOS course that stirred this whole process.
Apple's SwiftUI tutorials kept my interest, and I then returned to UIkit basics with the help of
Ray Wenderlich and Hacking with Swift. With only some of the basic understanding of implementing user interfaces,
I didn't feel worthy moving to a new team in a new domain, but as they say, it doesn't hurt to try.

After so many emails and lack of replies, I found my one Yes, and that's all I needed. So that must mean I'm officially
an iOS Engineer now?!

Throughout this process in finding a new role, I've learned a few things worth 
sharing.


#### I didn't get the role because of my skillset.
When interviewing for the position, it was well known that my skills as an iOS Developer would not be
on par with my years of experience as a Software Engineer. But what my interviewers saw was passion
and drive. -- **Passion** can make it or break it when getting that next job.


#### Learn the basics.
If you're looking to move into a new technical domain, it is fundamental to spend the time to learn
the basics. Obviously, coming in with knowledge is better than starting from zero. This will also show
the prospective team that you already have the drive to learn. If you have projects to show, that
is even better.


#### Your previous Software Engineer experience is an asset.
It's easy to believe that all the knowledge you acquired in one domain is useless to another. At the end of the day
an iOS Engineer is still a Software Engineer. I realized later on that my first two years made me more detailed, a better debugger, and a quick learner. After learning quite a few frameworks early in my career, from Flask, FastAPI, React, and Springboot, it made elements of the iOS development process simpler to understand. -- I had no issues catching up with
the engineers on the team.


#### Move internally.
When planning my move for a new position, I only planned for an internal transfer. I knew it was more feasible to move to a new domain within the same company as they know I already understand their engineering ecosystem. If you don't have that luxury, you'll have
to prove yourself even more in the interview processes with external companies.

In the end, I got my role! So far, I've been having so much fun learning and working on features that millions of people will be using. I write this post of my experience in hopes of allowing others to understand that anything is possible.
