I'm an iOS Engineer at Capital One. I ship code that provides 
a native mobile customer enrollment experience ("Set up Online Access") located right
in the Capital One Mobile banking app's initial view.


I've spent the first two years of my career working as a backend and dev-ops engineer.
I found a passion and interest with Swift and mobile development, and I haven't looked back since.


Follow my journey as I continue to grow as a Software Engineer specifically in the iOS and Mobile space.
